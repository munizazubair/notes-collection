# **h. Practical Application**

- Elements for effective prompts in content creation (topic, audience, tone, format), code generation (language, requirements, examples), customer feedback analysis (sentiment, themes, recommendations).

### **6-Part Prompting Framework**

### **1. Command: Start Strong**

- Use **action verbs**: Analyze, Create, Recommend, Generate.
- Avoid weak/wishy-washy words: “Give,” “Help.”
- Be **specific** and set a **professional tone**.

**Example:**

“Recommend a diversified investment strategy for a moderate-risk investor saving for a home within 5 years.”

---

### **2. Context: More is Better**

- Provide **background, constraints, goals** to guide AI.
- **Rule of Three:** Who (profile), What (goal/constraints), When (timeline).
- **Scale context** based on task complexity.

**Example:**

“32-year-old software engineer, moderate risk tolerance, saving $90K/year, goal: buy home in 5 years.”

---

### **3. Logic: Define Output**

- Specify **what to include** and **format**.
- Use **tables, lists, JSON, checklists** to structure response.

**Example:**

“List asset categories, allocation %, rationale, and recommended funds.”

---

### **4. Roleplay: Expert-Level**

- Assign a **persona** for expertise and tone.
- Customize by field (finance, marketing, tech, legal).

**Example:**

“You are a certified financial advisor with 15 years experience in mid-term investment planning for tech professionals.”

---

### **5. Formatting: Structure for Success**

- Organize for clarity: numbered lists, bullets, tables, headers, summaries.

**Example:**

1. Executive Summary
2. Asset Allocation Table
3. Investment Recommendations
4. Timeline & Milestones
5. Risk Considerations

---

### **6. Questions: Secret Sauce**

- After prompt (command + context + logic + roleplay + formatting), ask **tailoring questions**.
- Refines output and uncovers missing info.

**Example:**

“Ask me 10 questions to better tailor this strategy.”
