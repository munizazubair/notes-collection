# Image Generation

## 🧠 **AI Image Generation Prompting (Nano Banana)**

### **Core Principles**

1. **Specificity over Generality**

   * ❌ *Vague:* “a nice portrait”
   * ✅ *Better:* “hyper-realistic studio portrait with professional lighting”

2. **Visual Hierarchy**

   * Start with **main subject**
   * Add **environment/background**
   * Specify **lighting and mood**
   * Include **technical details**

3. **Professional Photography Language**

   * Use **camera terminology:** 85mm lens, f/1.4 aperture
   * Mention **lighting setups:** Rembrandt, studio, softbox, window light
   * Include **photography styles:** editorial, cinematic, fine art

### **Anatomy of an Effective Image Prompt**

Each prompt should include:

1. **Subject Description** – who or what
2. **Pose/Action** – body position or expression
3. **Environment** – background or setting
4. **Lighting** – type, direction, intensity
5. **Style** – artistic or professional aesthetic
6. **Technical Specs** – camera, lens, aperture
7. **Mood/Atmosphere** – emotional tone

### **📸 Basic Photography Definitions**

**Lens:**
The glass element on a camera that focuses light onto the sensor. It controls how much of the scene appears in the image and affects sharpness, background blur, and perspective.

**Focal Length:**
Measured in millimeters (mm), it determines how “zoomed in” the image appears.

* Short focal length (35mm) = wider view
* Long focal length (85mm, 135mm) = closer, compressed look

**Aperture:**
The adjustable opening in the lens that controls how much light enters the camera. A wider aperture lets in more light and creates background blur.

**f-stop (f/number):**
The numeric value that represents the size of the aperture.

* **Small f-number (f/1.4, f/2.8):** Wide aperture → bright image, blurry background (shallow depth of field)
* **Large f-number (f/8, f/11):** Narrow aperture → darker image, more detail in background (deep depth of field)

### **Professional Photography Terminology**

**Lenses & Focal Lengths**

* **85mm:** Best for portraits; natural perspective, soft background
* **50mm:** Mimics human vision; balanced and versatile
* **35mm:** Wider view; includes background context

**Aperture Settings (f-stops)**

* **f/1.4 – f/2.8:** Shallow focus, strong background blur
* **f/4 – f/5.6:** Balanced focus
* **f/8 – f/11:** Deep focus, environment visible

**Depth of Field**

* **Shallow:** Subject sharp, background blurred (isolated look)
* **Deep:** Both subject and background in focus

### **💡 Studio Lighting Setup**

**1. Key Light**

* Main source of light
* Sets exposure and defines main shadows
* Often placed 45° from the camera

**2. Fill Light**

* Secondary light that softens shadows
* Less bright than key light

**3. Rim (Hair) Light**

* Placed behind the subject
* Adds edge highlights for separation from the background

**4. Background Light**

* Illuminates the backdrop
* Adds depth and dimension to the image

💡 *Tip:* Combining these lights helps control contrast and achieve professional studio results.

### **Lighting Patterns**

* **Rembrandt:** Triangle of light on cheek, dramatic and classic
* **Butterfly:** Light above face, creates butterfly-shaped shadow under nose
* **Split:** Half face in shadow, half in light, moody effect
* **Loop:** Soft, flattering shadow beside nose

### **Best Practices**

1. **Anchor the Subject** – use “of the uploaded photo” for likeness
2. **Control the Scene** – describe walls, props, colors, background
3. **Specify Style & Mood** – cinematic, corporate, fine art, futuristic
4. **Use Photography Language** – lens, lighting, aperture for realism
5. **Add Branding Elements** – logos, text, geometric graphics
6. **Iterate in Layers** – refine prompts step by step (pose, mood, typography)

### **Style Categories**

| Category                          | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Corporate / Professional**      | Executive portraits, LinkedIn headshots, neutral background, even lighting |
| **Creative / Artistic**           | Fine art, black & white, emotional depth, candid look                      |
| **Fashion / Editorial**           | Magazine style, dramatic lighting, professional styling                    |
| **Lifestyle / Personal Branding** | Natural environment, casual yet confident, authentic feel                  |

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

* ❌ Too vague: “portrait of a man” → ✅ “corporate headshot with soft studio lighting”
* ❌ Conflicting styles: “vintage + futuristic” → pick one consistent look
* ❌ Overcomplicating: too many artistic terms confuse AI
* ❌ Missing elements: always include lighting, pose, and environment

* [ ] Subject clearly described
* [ ] Pose/positioning specific
* [ ] Lighting type and direction specified
* [ ] Environment/background detailed
