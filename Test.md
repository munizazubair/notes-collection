Part III — AI-Driven Development (AIDD) — Practical (Hands-on)
Exam Code: L2:P3.3-AIDD
Difficulty: High
Project: Develop and deploy an Agentic AI solution using Spec-Kit-Plus. This project tests your ability to follow an evaluation-driven and test-driven methodology to create a reliable, high-quality AI agent. The Client will conduct hands-on testing to evaluate specification quality and conformance, UI quality, functional correctness, test quality and coverage, and evaluation results.


Tasks:


Implement a comprehensive Agentic AI solution.
Develop Reusable Intelligence
Write tests first (TDD) and achieve green builds.
⁠Drive Development with Evals: Implement and use a robust evaluation harness (OpenAI Evals) to measure, analyze, and guide the development of the agent's performance.


Deliverables: Repository link including Spec-Kit Plus records and files, test report (pass/fail + coverage), eval report, reusable intelligence, and a concise README describing setup, assumptions, and how specs map to tests.


Duration: 4 hours
Allowed resources: Open Internet.
Scoring (rubric): Spec adherence (30%), test quality/coverage (30%), correctness & reliability (25%), clarity of README/eval results (15%).
Pass criteria: Overall ≥ 70%, with ≥ 60% in each part.
Prerequisite: The part will only be administered after you have passed Part I and II.
